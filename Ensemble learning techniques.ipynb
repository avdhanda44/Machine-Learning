    "  <p>\n",
    "    Ensemble learning techniques such as Bagging and Boosting are used to improve the performance and robustness of machine learning models, particularly decision trees. Both techniques involve combining multiple models to make more accurate predictions.\n",

    "  <h2 style=\"color: #FF69B4;\">Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "    Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the training data through random sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a separate model, and the final prediction is made by <strong>averaging</strong> or <strong>voting across</strong> the predictions of all the models. The main steps in the bagging process are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "  <ol>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Bootstrap Sampling:</strong> Randomly select subsets of the training data with replacement, creating multiple subsets of equal size.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Train a separate model on each subset of the data. Typically, the same learning algorithm (e.g., decision trees) is used to create each model.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Prediction Aggregation:</strong> For classification tasks, the final prediction is determined by majority voting among the predictions of all models. For regression tasks, the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all models.</li>\n",
    "  </ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "    Bagging helps reduce the variance and improve the stability of the predictions by combining models that are trained on slightly different subsets of the data. Popular bagging algorithms include Random Forest, which is an ensemble of decision trees created using bagging.\n",

    "  <h2 style=\"color: #FF69B4;\">Boosting</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "    Boosting is another ensemble technique that sequentially trains multiple models, with each subsequent model attempting to correct the mistakes made by the previous models. Boosting can be understood as an iterative process where each model focuses more on the examples that the previous models struggled to predict correctly. The main steps in the boosting process are as follows:\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <ol>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Base Model Training:</strong> Train an initial model on the entire training data.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Sample Weight Update:</strong> Assign weights to each training example. Initially, all examples have equal weights.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Model Training Iteration:</strong> Train a new model on the updated training data, where the weights of the misclassified examples are increased, making them more influential in the subsequent model.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Weight Update:</strong> Adjust the weights of the training examples based on the performance of the new model. Misclassified examples are assigned higher weights, while correctly classified examples are assigned lower weights.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Prediction Combination:</strong> Combine the predictions of all models using a weighted voting scheme or by taking a weighted average.</li>\n",
    "  </ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "    Boosting focuses on improving model accuracy by giving more attention to difficult examples in each iteration. It aims to create a strong ensemble model by iteratively refining the model's ability to handle challenging cases. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) and Gradient Boosting, which use decision trees as base models.\n",
    "  </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <p>\n",
    "    Both bagging and boosting can improve the performance and generalization ability of machine learning models. Bagging reduces variance and helps prevent overfitting, while boosting focuses on reducing bias and improving model accuracy. The choice between bagging and boosting depends on the specific problem, the available data, and the desired trade-off between model complexity and prediction accuracy.\n",

AdaBoost iteratively trains weak learners (e.g., decision stumps) by adjusting the weights of the training examples to emphasize the misclassified examples. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all weak learners.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Gradient Boosting:</strong> It is a general boosting framework that can be used with various base learners. Gradient Boosting iteratively trains models by fitting them to the negative gradients of the loss function, gradually improving the predictions.
